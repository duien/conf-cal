== Welcome to ConfCal (aka RubyConfirmate

ConfCal is a social personal conference scheduling tool.  You can compare
sessions for a given time slot, keep track of which ones you plan to attend,
and see who's going to what.

Right now, ConfCal is specific to RubyConf 2010 (see it in action at
rubyconfirmate.heroku.com).  Since it was mostly built the weekend before the
conference, it's still a little rough around the edges.  In the future, we hope
to mold it in to a more generalized (and better tested) tool.
